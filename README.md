# Fairytales!

This project is a creative web development assignment focused on building an interactive and visually engaging one-page scrolling website based on a fairytale. In addition to the main fairytale site, a central portal was developed to showcase all student projects. The portal includes a homepage with random featured projects, a full project gallery, and a “Making Of” section explaining the development process.
